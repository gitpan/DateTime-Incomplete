TODO file for DateTime::Incomplete

- more tests for next/previous with year and nanosecond

- time_zone tests

- locale implementation

IDEAS

* add_datetime

Just like to_datetime, but adds the field values.

* compare

or is that simply not defined?

* to_spanset

* to_span

* other C<DateTime> methods (strftime, locale ... )

* set_week

$dti->set( week => 10 )

* from_datetime

* to_recurrence( resolution => 'days' )

Generates a recurrence of such 'density' (now it always defaults to seconds)

* is_incomplete/is_complete

How do we know it is complete?
